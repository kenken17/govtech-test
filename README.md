The assignment are using vue-cli for bootstraping built on top of material design.

Folder strucutre are own improvise, tying to group the logical component in intuitive naming convention.

I have chose to use Vuex for managing single source of truth, though this small assigment might not needed.

Below are default project command from vue-cli:

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
You can vew the page on localhost.
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
Increas the max-length of code to 200 for readiblity purpose.
```
npm run lint
```

### Run your unit tests
I am running out of time, so only could cover 85%+ of the codebase. Please do run all the test after the command. (press a for all tests, should have 32 tests)
```
npm run test:unit
```
